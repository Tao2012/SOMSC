### SOMSC: Self-Organization-Map for High-Dimensional Single-Cell Data of Cellular States and Their Transitions
by Tao Peng and Qing Nie, 2017

#### Introduction
SOMSC algorithm is an effectiveness method of capturing cellular states, their transitions, pseudotime ordering of cells embeded in the high-dimensional single-cell data.

Any suggestions on the package are welcome! For suggestions and comments on the method, please contact Dr. Tao Peng (taop@uci.edu) or Dr. Qing Nie (qnie@math.uci.edu).

#### Setup and quick start

This package is developed on MATLAB. Please run startup.m first to set up the working directory. There are four datasets included in the SOMSC manuscript. You could run the following four demos to get all figures in the manuscript. 

- demo_simulation
- demo_embryo
- demo_hsc
- demo_olfactory
